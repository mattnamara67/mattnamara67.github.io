I’ve never been good at sleeping. Isn’t that pathetic? It’s something every human being does every night, and I’m terrible at it. I spend hours and hours staring at the ceiling, mind racing, thinking about what I did the past day, what I’ll have to put up with tomorrow, and every little mistake I’ve ever made in my life, strutting about in my brain like some fashion show of guilt.

Then came my new neighbor, who moved into the house right behind mine. I hadn’t met them yet, people don’t really know their neighbors anymore, but I was definitely getting to know their dog. Every night, conveniently around when I would start getting ready for bed, the thing would start barking and howling as loudly as possible. The first few nights I almost enjoyed the way the noise distracted me from torturous thoughts. But after a week the barks and the thoughts had learned to work together against me.

*Bark*

“Hey, remember that time you threw up in an Uber?”

*Bark bark*

“You’re not making much progress on that design document.”

*Bark bark bark awooooooo*

“You’re getting pretty old, I think the days of you being young are over.”

*Bark bark bark bark*

One evening, during the second week, I decided to peer through my back fence and see what the dog looked like. My eyes didn’t have to wander much before I saw my new friend, a rottweiler sleeping on a patch of yellow grass. This thing keeps me up for hours every night and the first time I see it it’s sleeping like a baby. A vein began pulsing in my forehead.

Suddenly, I had a cruel thought. If this thing won’t let me sleep, I’m not going to let it sleep. I’ll yell and hit against the fence until it wakes up, and then run back in my house. Hell, I’ll do that every evening! But before I could open my mouth the dog jumped up from its restful position. Wondering how difficult it would be for a rottweiler to break through the wood, I jumped back and considered going back inside. Then, there was an odd silence; no barking or howling or even sounds of movement came from the other side of the fence.

After a minute or two of anticipating the absent dog-rage, I decided to peer through the wood boards again. The creature was standing where I had last seen it, slowly turning its head left and right. When its eyes met mine, the turning stopped, and the dog began to approach. It seemed thin for a rottweiler, and the slow, deliberate way it advanced from its resting spot did not align with the chaotic monster I had always imagined it to be.

When it was about three feet away from the fence the dog stopped and began to whimper. That only lasted for a few seconds, enough to get the point across I guess, before it darted away and out of my sight. Once it was gone, I trekked back to my house and drifted through the usual late-night rituals before heading to bed. The entire time I felt a sharp twisting in my stomach. That poor dog, the way it whimpered. It’s like it knew what I was planning and knew it would be tortured by it. Was I really that awful to plot a revenge scheme against a dog? It was almost time for it to start barking again. Good, I didn’t deserve sleep.

Sure enough, the barking came. But there was something different that night. The barks sounded like they always did, but I now detected a meaning to them. It was like hearing a word you know in a different language. The sound might not be what you’re used to, but you can immediately map it to the right definition. That night, the barks had a meaning, and they only mapped to one word.

*Ben! Ben! Ben!*

Was I really listening to a dog say my name? I started to worry at first, but soon I calmed down and rationalized what was happening. Lack of sleep can have strange effects, hallucinations and all that. I was dealing with some pretty strong emotions concerning that dog, so was it really that unusual for my mind to start playing tricks on me? I considered looking for a therapist to talk to, but decided that one night wasn’t enough to take that step.

I spent the next day trying to do everything possible to keep my mind occupied. I listened to an audiobook on the drive to work. I focused as intensely as possible on every little task I had. I even tried striking up conversations with whichever familiar face I saw near my cubicle. By the evening I was exhausted, and the sad part was that my scheme only partially worked. Every gap between the exertions of mental energy was filled by thoughts of what happened the night before. I could hear the barking of my name echoing in my head. It was like the default state. Whenever my attention wasn’t fully on some other thing, I could only think of the barking.

*It’ll pass,* I thought to myself. *It won’t go away because it’s so fresh in your mind, but before you know it, you’ll forget what happened.*

I repeated different variations of that to myself as I crawled into bed and curled up in my blanket. My heart raced with terrified anticipation. Sure enough, the barking came. This time, however, the words were different.

*Ben, are you listening? Ben? Ben, are you there?*

Now I was seriously concerned. Hearing just one word over and over again could easily be explained by stress and insomnia. But complete sentences? What could make me hear that?

*Ben? Hello? Are you awake Ben?*

I pressed two pillows against my ears, desperate to prevent the sound waves from breaking through. It was of no use. The entire night was spent listening to the dog ask if I was awake. From sundown to sunrise it kept at it, only taking breaks for a few minutes at a time.  I tossed, I turned. I shut my eyes. I covered my ears. Nothing worked. For the past two weeks I was getting poor sleep. That night I got no sleep.

The barking stopped when dawn finally came. I spent the first hours of the morning sitting in bed, eyes fixed at the ceiling. Even though there was finally silence, I knew had absolutely no chance of falling back asleep. My mind kept moving, trying to find meaning from the night.

*Have I gone insane? Is this what insanity feels like? Does insanity come and go?*

I couldn’t be insane, that wasn’t an option. Insanity meant losing my job. Insanity meant losing my house. Insanity meant losing my car, my books, my friends… *don’t think about lost friends right now*. The point was that I couldn’t afford to lose my sanity, I had to find some other explanation, and decided that the issue wasn’t my mental state, but that there was something suspicious going on with that dog. The way it ran from the fence, that was my key piece of evidence. Dogs don’t act like that, they just don’t. It then occurred to me that the dog’s owner might know something. I didn’t want to confront them or anything like that, complaining to them wouldn’t do much good. No, this was going to be an investigation. I would come over, introduce myself very politely, ask questions about the dog, and see if any bizarre information slipped out. I wasn’t sure what kind of answers I was expecting, but it was worth a shot.

The owner was a well-built man who appeared to be in his late-20s. He wore a white tank top and black sweatpants, and when I glanced into his living room I thought I saw every type of dumbbell to ever exist sprawled out on the floor. I must admit that my first impression of the guy was that he was a total meathead. *Exercising, only stupid people do that!* But when we got to talking, I quickly began to feel guilty for my initial judgment. The man, Ken was his name, seemed genuinely touched by the fact that I had come over to introduce myself. He shook my hand firmly, and wasted no time inviting me inside for some coffee, which I was definitely willing to accept.

“Tell me about yourself,” said Ken as he handed me a filled mug. Despite how painfully hot it was, I tried taking a sip before answering.

“Well, I’m a pretty boring guy.” We shared a chuckle at that opener. “I mostly just go to work and then come home and play video games. You know, living my life to the fullest.”

We spent the next few minutes talking about mundane topics like our jobs and hobbies. It wasn’t the most engaging conversation, but Ken’s soft voice and slow, relaxed way of speaking charmed me. I actually found myself distracted by how pleasant it was to just hear him talk. At last, I remembered why I had come over in the first place.

“So, tell me about your dog.”

I could see a shift in Ken’s demeanor, from calmness to remorse. “Does his barking keep you up? I’m really, really sorry about that.”

“No, no, it’s not too bad. I barely even notice it most nights. I just wanted to know like… you know, where’d you get him? How long have you had him? Those kinds of things.”

I was struggling, afraid that Ken could see right through me.

“Oh, that kind of stuff. I guess it’s kind of related to the barking. I got him from a rescue a few months ago. They said his last owners abused him, wouldn’t feed him for a while and things like that. He’s been through a lot, and I’m trying to build him back up. He’s made progress but I think the move’s been tough on him. He didn’t used to bark so much until we came to this neighborhood.”

I wanted to go home and think through the implications of this information, it was interesting stuff to consider, but I had one more question.

“What’s his name?”

“Aaron.”

*Aaron. It had to be that name. Aaron.* I told Ken that he was doing a good thing by taking in that dog, thanked him for the coffee, and returned to my house. I didn’t care how abrupt my exit was, I had to leave. Even before Ken and his dog became my new neighbors, I always had trouble sleeping. Most of the time it was stress and insecurities that kept me up, but every so often I would spend the night fighting off memories of my old friend, Aaron Zaslofsky.

We met in high school, sometime during our sophomore year, and immediately formed a bond. We explored town together. We played basketball together. We went to concerts for shitty local bands together. Hell, there may have been some nights with underaged drinking, but you can’t prove a thing. I never would have done anything like that on my own. Before I met him, I was a total shut-in, too afraid to put myself out there and go do things. I assumed no one liked me, so I thought it was best to stay away from everyone and not bother them. Aaron ended that. He motivated me, made me feel strong. He was my best friend.

After graduation we began to drift apart. I went to a college in a different state, he stayed in our hometown. We tried talking to each other online as much as possible, but as the months went by our interactions became less and less frequent. By the second semester we would sometimes go a week at a time without communicating. It was sad, but our lives were going in different directions.

The last time Aaron called me was during finals week. Apparently, he had spent the past several days in the hospital with a severe case of pneumonia. The doctors kept saying he would be fine, but each day his body felt worse, and he was starting to panic.

“I just want to see you again,” he said in a weak, raspy voice. “I think that’ll help me calm down. How soon can you get here? Could you try getting here tomorrow?”

I was devastated, both by the news and the knowledge that I couldn’t fulfill his request. My flight home was booked for the next week, and I couldn’t skip my finals, there was no way the college would grant me an excuse just to see a sick friend. Maybe they would for a family member, but not a friend. When I explained the situation to him, he didn’t say anything in response. An awkward silence passed.

“As soon as I’m back I’ll visit you. For real, I’ll drive straight from the airport!” It was the truth. I fully intended on doing that.

“Okay” he said, and hung up. I had never heard him sound so disappointed.

Aaron Zaslofsky died the next day. He was 19 years old. I could still hear the sound of his coughing over the phone. I could still hear the pained way he said “Okay”. That was the last thing he ever said to me. That might have been the last thing he ever said to anyone.

Five years had gone by since his passing. Time made the wound less harsh but didn’t eliminate it completely. I don’t think you can ever get over losing a friend like that, but I was learning to live with the sadness. At least I thought I was, until this damn dog came into my life. Its name being Aaron had to be a coincidence. That’s just it, no way there was a connection. And the talking, that was just my stressed-out mind. Dogs don’t talk, end of story.

When that night’s barking began, I put on some headphones and played some of my most obnoxious music. However, halfway through the first song my phone went silent. I made sure the volume was turned up. It was. I tried playing another song. Still silent. I unplugged the headphones and tried playing it from the speaker. Nothing.

*Ben please, it’s Aaron.*

Ignore it, ignore it, ignore it, ignore it.

*I want to tell you something, but I need to know that you’re listening.*

Don’t do anything, just stay right there and wait out the night.

*Ben! Please!*

No, no, no, no, no.

*Ben please, I need you.*

…

…

…

I slipped on a sweatshirt before venturing out into the chilly darkness. It only took a few steps across the damp grass before arriving at the fence. Peering through the gaps, I saw the shape of the rottweiler, head raised towards the moonlit sky, preparing another bark. But before letting it out, the dog turned its head towards me, paused for a few seconds, and then slowly approached. Once it was satisfied with how close it was, it began to speak.

“It wasn’t your fault Ben. I understand why you couldn’t visit me right away. Don’t feel guilty. Don’t blame yourself for anything that happened. I know that you cared very deeply about me. You were a great friend.”

<p>*   *   *</p>

The dog didn’t bark at all for the next few nights. When it did begin to bark again, it was never with any words. I’m not sure if it’s gone back to barking every night. It might, but I’m not awake to hear it. I’ve been sleeping better lately.
