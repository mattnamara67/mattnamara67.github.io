*The following was based off a dream.*

A Thursday evening, approximately 6:00 PM. The cafeteria was cleared out of tables except for one row in the back, which held containers of food for the attendees, along with paper plates and plastic utensils. The selection was mostly cheap burger patties and some cold sandwiches. For beverages, there were two large ice chests filled with sodas, water bottles, and Gatorades. It wasn’t exactly a banquet or anything, but people weren’t here for a fancy meal. Taking the place of the absent tables were rows of green chairs, with a ten-foot gap separating two masses, like the aisle at a wedding. The left side, from the stage’s point of view, was for my family. My parents were seated in the front row, beaming with pride. My siblings were next to them, smiling as well, and behind them were more distant relatives, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and a whole lot of cousins. In the front row on the right were my closest friends, the ones who had been with me at my most vulnerable. They had no obligation to be in my life, nothing forced them to invest their care into me, but we had come together anyway. Behind them were acquaintances, people who I enjoyed speaking to but never really built a close bond with, and in the very back were contemporaries. I knew almost nothing about those people, but they were always there, and that mattered.

I was seated on the right side of the stage, in the middle was a podium, and on the left were eight men in suits, the ones who would bestow the honor. I had done my best to match their business attire, with a black blazer, slacks, a silver dress shirt, and a turquoise tie, but I felt like I was barely making it. The tie was too bizarre, I should have picked a more typical color, but what even is a typical tie color? I investigated the group. A red-faced man had an orange one with small, blue dots. Next to him was an older-looking man, with a gray tie that matched the color of his beard. The more I concentrated on their appearances, the more I realized that I had absolutely no idea who they were. This wasn’t just vague unfamiliarity; these people were complete strangers. I felt a twist in my stomach but shook it off. I might not have known who they were, but I knew exactly how the night was going to go. I knew what was going to happen.

I took a deep breath, exhaled, and smiled. The cafeteria had been loud with conversation, but as soon as I had let out the breath it began to quiet down. After a few minutes the bearded man rose from his seat and approached the podium. The audience applauded as he went, and I joined them. After clearing his throat and saying “thank you” a couple of times, he began.

“I’m sure we’re all very excited to recognize this young man and what he’s accomplished. An occasion like this happens very rarely, and it’s worth celebrating.

Applause. I felt too embarrassed to clap.

“Now, we understand that your mother has prepared a short video for us to present here. If everyone would please pay attention to the screen.”

Behind him, a screen slowly descended from the ceiling with a mechanical whirr as he returned to his seat. Once the screen was fully extended, the cafeteria’s projector activated and began playing the video. It was a cute little compilation of pictures from my life. At first there were baby pictures, confused expressions on my chubby face. Then it proceeded to early childhood, soccer games, birthday parties, playing outside with other kids in my old neighborhood. I had forgotten so many of their names, but the instant I saw their faces it felt like they were seated right next to me. Then it showed pictures from school. I was staring at papers, pencil in my hand, eyebrows clenched in concentration. Then, I was talking to friends at the lunch table. These faces I did recognize; they were in the audience. When a picture came up with me seated next to this one girl, I heard her voice from the back call out “hey, that’s me!” Everyone laughed.  

After another minute or so, the video ended. I was relieved, the surge of nostalgia and sentimentality was getting to me. The audience applauded, and the bearded man approached the podium again. This time, however, he stopped about three feet away, and clapped his hands twice. A rope dropped from the ceiling, with a noose at its end, hovering above the podium.  

“And now Matthew, we’d like you to take the stage.”

I obeyed. When I reached the podium, one of the well-dressed people tied the noose around my neck. While they did this, I noticed a small trap door open next to the bearded man. From it ascended a lever, slowly rising until the handle met his left hand. Someone then tied a cloth around my eyes.

“If you have any last words, now is the time,” the bearded man said.  

My heart raced, I had been thinking about this for weeks, ever since the occasion was scheduled. There was a moment where I had the last phrase settled, but for the life of me I couldn’t remember it. A quote, it was a quote. From *A Tale of Two Cities*. Something about rest. Rest and good deeds. I couldn’t remember it. Maybe this was a mistake?

The man pulled the lever. I dropped, and stopped.
