Here it is, a silly little blog for my creative writing made using Jekyll. After much indecision, I've gone with [Type on Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap) as my theme. Eventually I might make my own theme but I like Type on Strap very much, especially the way it looks on mobile.

I've posted two short stories to start off the blog - "A Night on the Roof", which I wrote last weekend, and "The Last Tyrannosaur", which I wrote just a few hours ago. "A Night on the Roof" was an idea I had floating around in my head for a long time. I posted it to a Google doc, shared it with friends, and got some very good feedback on it, including requests for a sequel, which I might do if I come up with a good idea.

"The Last Tyrannosaur" is very short, only around 200 words long. I don't think I can even call it a story, it's more of an attempt to describe a short part of a dinosaur video that I've always been fond of. [Here's a link](https://youtu.be/l54RToobSHU?t=88). As a child, I was utterly obsessed with dinosaurs, so expect more dinosaur stories in the future.

I hope people enjoy this blog. Constructive feedback is appreciated of course, send it to [mattnamara67@gmail.com](mailto:mattnamara67@gmail.com).
