The blasted plain that lay before him was once a meadow. Flowers of every shape and color grew here, waving in the wind, feeding his prey. He used to hide himself in a line of trees on the outskirts, silently waiting. When one of the sick or young got too close, heâ€™d announce himself with a great roar and sink his teeth into their neck. He loved the feeling of bones crushing in his jaws. He loved the taste of blood. A great meal, an earned meal.

Now the flowers were gone, along with the creatures they fed. All that remained were bones dotting the landscape. He stood there alone, a shriveled remnant laboriously inhaling the foul air. Instinct commanded him to move forward. Perhaps there were still corpses somewhere to feed on? It took all his strength to lift one foot and clumsily take the first step. Attempting to lift the other sent him collapsing to the earth. There he was, sprawled out on his stomach, barely clinging to consciousness. His eyes could no longer distinguish between the barren ground and clouded sky. All he could see now were shades of grey swirling around each other, until their movement ceased and everything turned black.
