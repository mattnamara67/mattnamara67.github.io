I arrived before Alex. I thought I would. He had to prepare a few things, all I had to do was show up. I had no idea what would happen or how long it would take. Maybe this was a bad idea? But I had to see for myself, and Alex desperately wanted to show somebody.

The school seemed smaller at night. As I looked out at the parking lot, I imagined how it appeared during the week, an impassable maze of Jeeps and Hondas, trucks and sedans, inching bit by bit towards the exits. High school was painful enough to sit through without taking forever to leave.

Before long, I could see a figure approaching from the far end of the lot. The darkness obscured the details of its face, but who else could it be but Alex? As he got near I could see the large eyes and fair skin that made him look younger than his sixteen years. There was a briskness to his stride, and the minute our eyes met I could see him try and fail to suppress a smile. It was charming, I had never seen him so excited.

“How long did I keep you waiting?” he asked.

“Not too long, do you have everything you need?”

“Definitely. There was still a ton of ash left in our grill from last night, and you know I always have the book with me.”

That book, *Shadows and Their Stories*, consumed Alex ever since he checked it out from the library. Every free moment of the day he had his face buried in the thing, only diverting his attention to jot down notes in a spiral. The first week I hardly noticed. It wasn’t unusual to be engrossed in an interesting read after all. But my suspicion grew in the second week. The thing only looked 100 pages long, 150 pages max. He must have finished it by now? In the third week my suspicion turned into concern, and I decided to talk to him.

“What’s the deal with the book, Alex? You’re *always* reading it. It’s starting to freak me out.”

He raised his head from the pages, looking as if he had just woken from a nap. It was lunchtime. Once again, he hadn’t touched any of his food.

“Huh?” was all he could say.

“The book,” I said, “What's it even about?”

Alex’s face lit up. He looked down, and showed me the cover. It was completely black, except for the white words of its title in large, serif font, and two glowing orbs below.

“It’s about demons,” he began. “Who they are, what they like, and what they can do. I thought it was just spooky shit at first. But then…”

He started laughing. I could feel my heart pounding against my chest, like a prisoner trying to break free.

“… I heard one!” he said in a thrilled whisper. “It only said one word to me. ‘Roof!’ I know it was one of them! It sounded just like the book described! Deep, gravely, and your ears just *overflow* with the voice! It’s hard to explain, but I have to show someone. I need someone else to experience it with me!”

Every logical part of my brain wanted to call the cops or tell the principal or find some responsible adult that could get this guy under control. If I left him like this then he could hurt himself or someone around him.

But I couldn’t help but feel an attraction. Here was a guy, one of the smartest guys I knew, ranting about demons in a cafeteria. Normal people don’t just snap like that. There was some piece of knowledge that he encountered in the book that changed him. Would it change me too? Temptation ate at me, until I found myself speaking.

“I want you to show me.”

That was on Wednesday, and we spent the next two days preparing. The book contained one summoning ritual, it was how Alex had heard the voice, and supposedly the two of us together could create a strong enough link to hear more than just a word. “We can conduct an interview and write our own book,” Alex would say. We took the word “roof” as an instruction. The ritual worked best on flat surfaces, and our high school’s roof seemed like the perfect spot. The actual process of the ritual was surprisingly straightforward.

“One of us creates a circle of ash, about a meter in diameter,” Alex explained. “In the middle we place a food offering. According to the book, they like grapes and cheese. We don’t need a lot, just enough to feed one person. I still have some left over from last time. The ashes should be easy too, I’ll just scoop some out of my dad’s grill, he likes using charcoal. The book doesn’t say what kind of ashes they need to be, and it did work before. Once all this is set up, we stand on opposite ends of the circle chanting, ‘*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant*.’ I’ll tell you what that means afterwards. I want it to be a surprise.”

Alex wrote the phrase down and told me to memorize it. That was my only assignment before the big night. We chose to do it Saturday rather than Friday because we thought there was less of a chance of being noticed by people doing some weird, late-night extracurricular. I wasn’t sure if I would actually experience anything, but chanting a weird Latin phrase in the middle of the night with my likely-insane friend would still make for a creepy experience. It felt like going to the movies to see a horror film. You know what you’ll see won’t be real, but the *fear* certainly will be.

At last, the night arrived. Alex had the grapes, the cheese, the ashes, and the book in case we needed more instruction. I had the words firmly committed to memory. The next step was to get to the roof, which turned out to be easier than expected. Our high school was a large campus, made up of separate buildings, and towards the western side there was a maintenance shed that had a ladder built into its back. Once we had ascended to the top we were able to climb onto an air-conditioning apparatus that connected to the main building, and after slipping through one tight crack we were there. A flat, featureless expanse of concrete lay before us. We trekked to the middle, it seemed like the ideal spot, and once we were settled, Alex began to unpack.

First, he set a red dinner plate on the ground and delicately placed the contents of a plastic container onto it, a modest collection of grapes and a few blocks of cheddar. When I saw the grapes I jokingly asked, “Did you remember to wash those things?” He replied, with odd sincerity, “of course.”

Now that the offering was prepared, the next step was to make the circle. Alex had the ashes in another plastic container, and carefully dumped them out while walking around the plate. There the grapes and cheese were, in the dead center of a ring of grey powder, the diameter looking close enough to a meter for my American eyes. After he had taken a moment to check the book for any steps he may have missed, Alex darted to the ring of ash and beckoned me to stand opposite from him. He raised his hands, palms facing the sky, eyes on the plate. I did the same. Then the chanting began.

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

Suddenly, the plate burst into flames. It was incredible! Alex wasn’t insane!

“Don’t stop!”

I obeyed.

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

As I chanted, my eyes focused on the soft glow of the flames.

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

We were getting louder.

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*Avē, umbra, moritūrī tē salūtant!*”

“*AVĒ, UMBRA, MORITŪRĪ TĒ SALŪTANT!*”

The chanting stopped. The cracking of the flames stopped. Now there was just a plate of white ashes. I couldn’t move. I tried with every ounce of my strength to bring my arms down, but they wouldn’t budge. I stood there, frozen in that strange position, and noticed that I had gone deaf. I couldn’t hear cars in the distance, chirping insects, or even my own breath, just a complete silence.

I wanted to look at Alex, but the minute I tried moving my eyes, I felt a sharp sting, like a needle plunging into my cornea. Then the sting turned into a savage burning. I tried shutting them, but my eyelids were paralyzed too. I could only stand there, eyes locked in total agony. Soon the fire spread to the rest of my face, and continued to creep down my neck. The muscles beneath my skin pulsated, and the heat was unbearable. I wondered how long it would take before my nose and ears melted off and slid to the concrete floor. But there was no floor beneath my feet. I no longer saw a plate of ash, but a blood red sky, with small, white stars and black silhouettes of trees below. By now, the burning had engulfed my entire being.

Suddenly, though my muscles still throbbed, I was able to focus my attention on a new sensation. Something was softly touching the back of my head. The burning didn’t feel so bad in that area, although it hadn’t disappeared completely. Then I felt more touches surrounding the center one. It was a hand! Was it Alex? I wished, desperately wished, it was, but whatever touched me didn’t have fingertips. Instead, there were hard surfaces that ended in sharpened points. I was caught in this creature’s talons.

Almost as if it were waiting for that realization, the hand began sinking its claws into my skull. I screamed until I could feel my throat tearing apart, but no sound came. All I could hear were the deafening cracks in my cranium, every split in the bone unleashing a new wave of torture. It never got better, every moment was different, every second of stabbing felt as shocking and unfamiliar as the first one. I continued to scream, it was all I could do, hoping to hear myself. By now the tips of the claws were past the layer of skull and sunk themselves into the soft mass of brain. I wanted so desperately to die at that moment. It had to end. Nothing else mattered. The burning, the throbbing, the piercing, the claws. I couldn’t bear them. I needed death.

In an instant, I was on my back against the concrete, staring at the black night sky. I shot upright, and felt the back of my head. No holes, no blood. The burning was gone, I was back on the roof with Alex.

Trembling, neither of us had the strength to stand. For a moment I thought it was all a hallucination, but the plate still held ashes. I didn’t know if Alex experienced what I had, but we shared the same expression, mouths slightly open, with the eyes of lost children. After an eternity of silence, Alex finally looked down, cleared his throat, and looked back to me.

“He likes you.”
