800,000 people were killed in 100 days, and that was just the start. I had heard about the Rwandan Genocide and Congo Wars, but didn't really understand them. 800,000 was just a big number to me. Jason K. Stearns's *Dancing in the Glory of Monsters* makes you understand what these kinds of atrocities look, feel, and sound like. But the most remarkable thing about this book is how it utterly rejects stopping at condemnation. Anyone can rise up and say "murder and genocide shouldn't happen." That's easy. What's hard is understanding *how* they happen, and *why*. What makes human beings do this to one another?

The reasons are complex, but the best I can say is that the Congo, like many third-world countries, lacks strong institutions. There's next to no bureaucracy, and because he feared rivals to his dictatorship, Mobutu let the army rot away to such an extent that a country the size of Western Europe routinely found itself at the mercy of its much smaller neighbors, in need of other countries like Angola and Zimbabwe to come to its aid. Without any institutions to maintain stability and promote the general welfare, Zaire became a breeding ground for ethnic hatred, corruption, and demagogues. Was Laurent Kabila, Mobutu's successor as ruler of the country, a demagogue? He certainly engaged in anti-Tutsi demagoguery to rally the country against Rwanda, but underneath that was a man who genuinely believed in Marxist revolutionary liberation. Unfortunately, the challenge of the Congo was just too great for him, and really, who could possibly be capable of leading that country to stability, especially with the turmoil of the Rwandan Civil War at its border? Many people tried,  and I'm especially saddened by the tale of Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the principled scholar who sought to apply his intellectualism for the good of his country and ended up a pariah.

No hero will descend from the heavens to make all things right. Building a stable, prosperous country in the Congo will take generations. The people want it, and one of the great things this book does is dismiss the image of the Congolese as a bunch of barbaric primitives. Much like us Westerners, those people respond to the incentives they encounter, economic, social, and political. I can only imagine what I would do if I were in their situation.

Will Congo ever achieve peace? I'm not sure, but after reading about all the horrible things its people have gone through since the Belgians first arrived, all I can say is I desperately want it to.
