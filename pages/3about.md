There's not much to say about me. I write things for fun. My name's not actually "Matt Namara" but it isn't too different from that.
I decided to use a pseudonym because they're fun. If you want to get to know me better (like my real name) then email me at [mattnamara67@gmail.com](mailto:mattnamara67@gmail.com).
I don't find myself very interesting, so to make this easier, I'll just answer random questions that no one asked.

# Why's the blog called 'Must Maintain'?
It's based off a lyric from Nas's "NY State of Mind" (a fantastic song on a fantastic album, listen to it immediately). They
lyric goes "Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain" and it really is an approach to life that I love. Everyone goes through hard times at some point in their life. Your struggles might be different from mine, let's not make this a contest, but it's definitely a universal human experience. The approach to struggle I've always admired the most is to continue to enjoy life and work towards goals in spite of the hardship. Be Sisyphus rolling the stone up the mountain. Endure it. Smile and laugh at life's pathetic attempts to keep you down. Maintain.

Is it pretentious? Yes. But I didn't want it to be something lame like "Matt's blog". The pretentious title is a perfect fit for the pretentious, pseudo-intellectual nature of my writing.

# What types of things will you write?
Short stories, movie/book reviews, and a few random thoughts sprinkled in. I mostly want to write horror but I also want to branch out from that into sci-fi, tragedy, comedy, and historical fiction.

# Why can't I leave comments?
Because nobody looks at this thing so why bother maintaining a comment system? If you want to give feedback on a story then send me an email. If you ask, I'll include the feedback in an edit under the story. If somehow people actually end up reading this thing and enough of them demand comments then maybe I'll do it.

# How often do you plan on writing?
When I have the time and the inspiration. Maybe never.

# Why did you go with "Matt Namara" as a pseudonym?
One of the movies that had the greatest effect on how I see the world is *The Fog of War*, which is basically an extended interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. It was captivating seeing someone who was once one of the most powerful people in the world be so candid about the mistakes he made and the horrible things he's done. Do I admire McNamara? Not really, he was a tremendously flawed person. But I liked the way his last name sounded, so I refitted it around my first name. "McNamara" -> "MattNamara" -> "Matt Namara".

# How do you pronounce "Namara"?
I don't know, it's a fake name, pronounce it how you want. The "Namara" part of "McNamara" goes *Nuh-mare-uh* but in my head I pronounce "Namara" as *Nam*(rhyme with "dam")-*uh*-*ruh* but since nobody ever talks to me it doesn't matter how you say it.

# Favorite movie?
*Jurassic Park*, it has a lot of personal meaning. Other contenders: *The Godfather I & II*, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *Goodfellas*, *The Big Lebowski*, *No Country for Old Men*, *The Blair Witch Project*, and plenty of others.

# Favorite book?
Probably *East of Eden*. I've been trying to read more lately, now that I'm done with college.

# Favorite album?
*Illmatic*. I don't know much about music but I really, really love that album.

# What do you do for a living?
I type things on a computer.

# Where do you live?

America

# How old are you?

Born in the late-90s

# What do you do for fun?
Nothing, I hate fun.

# Are you on [insert social media site here]?
Yeah probably. Email me for them.

# Your attempts at self-deprecation are just a defense mechanism from legitimately putting yourself out there for criticism.
Who are you and will you be my therapist?
